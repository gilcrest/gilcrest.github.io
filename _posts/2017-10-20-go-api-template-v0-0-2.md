Hello Gopher community! This represents my first code release, albeit a minor one.  I'm hopeful that this will be helpful.  I believe in templates and am trying to put together a working API template from all the best practices I've found in the Go community. There's more details on the github readme [here][go-api-template]

Thanks!
