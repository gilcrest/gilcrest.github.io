Errors are first class citizens and there are many different approaches for handling them. Initially I started off basing my error handling almost entirely on a blog post from Rob Pike and created a carve-out from his code to meet my needs. It served me well for a long time, but found over time I wanted a way to easily get a stacktrace of the error, which led me to Dave Cheney&amp;rsquo;s https://github.</description></item><item><title>Jekyll to Hugo Conversion</title><link>https://gilcrest.github.io/posts/conversion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://gilcrest.github.io/posts/conversion/</guid><description>Today I converted my old posts from jekyll to HUGO and archived them for posterity.

I thought it might be helpful for some. At the very least, I tried to document the library reasonably well, spending a lot of time developing the README and ensuring the GoDoc was in good shape. I learned a lot through this exercise.
I also restructured my Go API template repository to try and shape it based on Mat Ryer’s fantastic “How I write Go HTTP services after seven years” post.</description></item><item><title>Basic Redis Examples with Go</title><link>https://gilcrest.github.io/posts/archive/basic-redis-examples/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 20:38:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://gilcrest.github.io/posts/archive/basic-redis-examples/</guid><description>Redis is pretty great.
