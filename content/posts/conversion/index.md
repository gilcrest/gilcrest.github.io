Today I converted my old posts from [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and archived them for posterity. It's fun to look back at some of those posts now -- so much has changed for me...

My new site is going to start minimalist and I'll add to it over time.

I'm using the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme, which has [great guides](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/)
