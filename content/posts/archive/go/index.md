Eureka!  After many many brushes with many different languages over many many years, I think I finally found the language that is right for me - Go!  It's hard to say why really, but something about learning this language feels right - it's well thought out, has a great community and is making programming fun again for me.  It's built in http libraries are incredible.  I'm just beginning, but this could be my forever language :)
