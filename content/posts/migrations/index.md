A few weeks ago, I gave a presentation to the [Boston Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bostongo/) on **Low-Dependency Database Migrations and Integration**, in which I discuss how I handle database migrations and database integration in the [go-api-basic](https://github.com/gilcrest/go-api-basic) project that I've been working on. In the presentation I mention several tools that I use, so I wanted to add links to them here.

- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [JetBrains DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/)

The video for the talk is below:
